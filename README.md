# Pymaceuticals

In a study involving 249 mice with SCC tumor growth, treated through a variety of drug regimens over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. 

After cleaning the data by removing duplicates, tables and figures for the report of the study were generated. 

A Summary Statistics Table:

Bar plots showing the total number of timepoints for all mice tested for each drug regimen throughout the course of the study:

A pie plot showing the distribution of female or male mice:




Final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the most promising treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. 

Quartiles and IQR:

Quantitatively determine if there are any potential outliers across all four treatment regimens.



Box and whisker plot of the final tumor volume for all four treatment regimens:

A random mouse that was treated with Capomulin was selected. 
Here is a line plot of tumor volume vs. time point for that mouse.
