# Pymaceuticals

In a study involving 249 mice with SCC tumor growth, treated through a variety of drug regimens over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. 

After cleaning the data by removing duplicates, tables and figures for the report of the study were generated.

Then, the final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the most promising treatment regimens (Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin) was found.

A random mouse that was treated with Capomulin was selected. 
Here is a line plot of tumor volume vs. time point for that mouse.
