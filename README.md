# Pymaceuticals

In a study involving 249 mice with SCC tumor growth, treated through a variety of drug regimens over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. 

After cleaning the data by removing duplicates, tables and figures for the report of the study were generated.

Then, the final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the most promising treatment regimens (Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin) was found.

A random mouse that was treated with Capomulin was selected.

# Observations and Inferences

1. There is a positive correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume. As mouse weight increases, so does the mean tumor volume. 

2. Capomulin has the second smallest standard deviation, mean, and median of tumor volume out of all the drugs, with Ramicane having the smallest in all these categories. 

2. Capomulin has the smallest interquartile range out of these 4 drugs: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin.
